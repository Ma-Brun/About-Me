                <h1>Me:</h1>
                <p1>I am a 17 year old Milton Academy student, Class of 2027, living in Wolocott house as a boarder.
                    I grew up and have lived in Manhattan, New York, all of my life, and recently spent my first semester of junior year abroad in Spain (<a href='https://www.sya.org'>SYA</a>).
                    I went to middle school at a small Episcapalion school in Greenwich Village in Manhattan called St. Luke's.
                    As a kid I was baptized Episcapalion like my father was, however I no longer consider myself to be.
                    My mother was born and raised in Tehran, Iran, and spent her formative years and high school in Los Angeles. 
                    My father was born and raised in Brooklyn and spent his formative years there as well, later going on to spend his junior and senior years at Milton Academy.
                    I've played almost every sport there is to play: Basketball, Soccer, and Squash for all about ten years now. I have also played football, skied, snowboarded, played lacrosse, swam, and track and field.
                    I love to play basketball, cook, workout, and sleep. That's all there is to me!
